the App is suppose to get items from the table ask the customer to chose which he or she want to buy and how much of the item they want to buy then it's suppose to check if the item is instock or not. If there is some of the item then the app is suppose to calculate what price the customer is going to pay by multipling the amount they want with the price

it started doing that when i added the function that got the items to make them into an array and ask the customer what item they wanted. when i got rid of it i diplayed the items with the initial query then i started the my function and query for buy the items again from scratch which ended up with the unexpected token error thing
